 # Ideas
 
 * Have a scene with 1-9 chunks and put the menu over it, like Factorio.
 * Fade in new chunks; use a shader to multiply the mesh of a chunk by a transparency value when it spawns.
 * What if we can decrease the voxel size?
 * Why should chunks be 16*16*386?
 * Can we turn it into a zombie/base defense game?
 * Runescape crafting style, you need items in the world to do it.
   * Can we generate a town or city? Very randomly of course!
   * Generate chunks in two trips; one for the map and one for the quests, enemies etc
   *
